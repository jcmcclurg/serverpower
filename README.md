# Repository description
This repository contains the work we've done for a power-aware computer cluster

## power_modulating_interfaces
This directory contains sample code for modulating the power consumption of the server via different interfaces. At the time of writing, we are focusing on doing this by modulating the CPU utilization of the processor.

## remotePowerMeasurement
This directory contains the code for interacting with the data acquisition unit, streaming power measurements, and receiving those power streams.

## utilities
This directory contains useful utilities for measuring computer performance and infrastructure for performing tests.

## profiling
This directory contains scripts for remotely running profiling tests on the cluster. It also contains measured data for key experiments.

## unused
This directory contains various leftover artifacts that I'm afraid to delete, but don't use. It will eventually go away.
