Funduino Xbee Adapter has two possible Linux drivers, see www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm

This implementation is for VCP; to use the D2XX driver see "FTDI Drivers Installation Guide for Linux".

To ensure all FTDI devices have VCP driver support, FTDI recommends installing the latest kernel release on the Linux system. In Linux, the VCP drivers will appear as /dev/ttyUSBx. 
How to verify the built-in COM port:
- Plug in a FTDI based design/module/cable
- Open a terminal window, and enter 
	dmesg | grep FTDI  <ret>
- Should output something like the following:
	[10170.987708] USB Serial support registered for FTDI USB Serial Device 
	[10170.987915] ftdi_sio 9-1:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected 
	[10170.991172] usb 9-1: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0 
	[10170.991219] ftdi_sio: v1.6.0:USB FTDI Serial Converters Driver

Now use the RS-232 libraries to use the Xbee as /dev/ttyUSB0
