.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a flexible, command-line-oriented frontend to Gnuplot. It creates
plots from data coming in on \s-1STDIN\s0 or given in a filename passed on the
commandline. Various data representations are supported, as is hardcopy
output and streaming display of live data. A simple example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ seq 5 | awk \*(Aq{print 2*$1, $1*$1}\*(Aq | feedgnuplot
.Ve
.PP
You should see a plot with two curves. The \f(CW\*(C`awk\*(C'\fR command generates some data to
plot and the \f(CW\*(C`feedgnuplot\*(C'\fR reads it in from \s-1STDIN\s0 and generates the plot. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`awk\*(C'\fR invocation is just an example; more interesting things would be plotted
in normal usage. No commandline-options are required for the most basic
plotting. Input parsing is flexible; every line need not have the same number of
points. New curves will be created as needed.
.PP
The most commonly used functionality of gnuplot is supported directly by the
script. Anything not directly supported can still be done with options such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-set\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-extracmds\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`\-\-style\*(C'\fR, etc. Arbitrary gnuplot commands can be
passed in with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-extracmds\*(C'\fR. For example, to turn off the grid, you can pass
in \f(CW\*(C`\-\-extracmds \*(Aqunset grid\*(Aq\*(C'\fR. Commands \f(CW\*(C`\-\-set\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-unset\*(C'\fR exists to
provide nicer syntax, so this is equivalent to passing \f(CW\*(C`\-\-unset grid\*(C'\fR. As many
of these options as needed can be passed in. To add arbitrary curve styles, use
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-style curveID extrastyle\*(C'\fR. Pass these more than once to affect more than one
curve.
.PP
To apply an extra style to \fIall\fR the curves that lack an explicit \f(CW\*(C`\-\-style\*(C'\fR,
pass in \f(CW\*(C`\-\-styleall extrastyle\*(C'\fR. In the most common case, the extra style is
\&\f(CW\*(C`with something\*(C'\fR. To support this more simply, you can pass in \f(CW\*(C`\-\-with
something\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`\-\-styleall \*(Aqwith something\*(Aq\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`\-\-styleall\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-with\*(C'\fR are mutually exclusive. Furthermore any curve-specific \f(CW\*(C`\-\-style\*(C'\fR
overrides the global \f(CW\*(C`\-\-styleall\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-with\*(C'\fR setting.
.SS "Data formats"
.IX Subsection "Data formats"
By default, each value present in the incoming data represents a distinct data
point, as demonstrated in the original example above (we had 10 numbers in the
input and 10 points in the plot). If requested, the script supports more
sophisticated interpretation of input data
.PP
\fIDomain selection\fR
.IX Subsection "Domain selection"
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`\-\-domain\*(C'\fR is passed in, the first value on each line of input is
interpreted as the \fIX\fR\-value for the rest of the data on that line. Without
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-domain\*(C'\fR the \fIX\fR\-value is the line number, and the first value on a line is
a plain data point like the others. Default is \f(CW\*(C`\-\-nodomain\*(C'\fR. Thus the original
example above produces 2 curves, with \fB1,2,3,4,5\fR as the \fIX\fR\-values. If we run
the same command with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-domain\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ seq 5 | awk \*(Aq{print 2*$1, $1*$1}\*(Aq | feedgnuplot \-\-domain
.Ve
.PP
we get only 1 curve, with \fB2,4,6,8,10\fR as the \fIX\fR\-values. As many points as
desired can appear on a single line, but all points on a line are associated
with the \fIX\fR\-value at the start of that line.
.PP
\fICurve indexing\fR
.IX Subsection "Curve indexing"
.PP
By default, each column represents a separate curve. This is fine unless sparse
data is to be plotted. With the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dataid\*(C'\fR option, each point is represented by
2 values: a string identifying the curve, and the value itself. If we add
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-dataid\*(C'\fR to the original example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ seq 5 | awk \*(Aq{print 2*$1, $1*$1}\*(Aq | feedgnuplot \-\-dataid \-\-autolegend
.Ve
.PP
we get 5 different curves with one point in each. The first column, as produced
by \f(CW\*(C`awk\*(C'\fR, is \fB2,4,6,8,10\fR. These are interpreted as the IDs of the curves to
be plotted. The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-autolegend\*(C'\fR option adds a legend using the given IDs to
label the curves. The IDs need not be numbers; generic strings are accepted. As
many points as desired can appear on a single line. \f(CW\*(C`\-\-domain\*(C'\fR can be used in
conjunction with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dataid\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIMulti-value style support\fR
.IX Subsection "Multi-value style support"
.PP
Depending on how gnuplot is plotting the data, more than one value may be needed
to represent the range of a single point. Basic 2D plots have 2 numbers
representing each point: 1 domain and 1 range. But if plotting with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-circles\*(C'\fR, for instance, then there's an extra range value: the radius. A
similar situation exists with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-colormap\*(C'\fR where each point contains the
position \fIand\fR the color. There are other gnuplot styles that require more data
(such as error bars), but none of these are directly supported by the script.
They can still be used, however, by specifying the specific style with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-style\*(C'\fR, and specifying how many values are needed for each point with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-rangesizeall\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rangesize\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-extraValuesPerPoint\*(C'\fR. Those options
that specify the range size are required \fIonly\fR for styles not explicitly
supported by feedgnuplot; supported styles do the right thing automatically.
.PP
More examples: if making a 2d plot of y error bars where gnuplot expects a
(x,y,ydelta) tuple for each point, you want \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rangesizeall 2\*(C'\fR because you have
one domain value (x) and 2 range values (y,ydelta). Gnuplot can also plot
lopsided y errorbars by giving a tuple (x,y,ylow,yhigh). This is similar as
before, but you want \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rangesizeall 3\*(C'\fR instead.
.PP
\fI3D data\fR
.IX Subsection "3D data"
.PP
To plot 3D data, pass in \f(CW\*(C`\-\-3d\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`\-\-domain\*(C'\fR \s-1MUST\s0 be given when plotting 3D
data to avoid domain ambiguity. If 3D data is being plotted, there are by
definition 2 domain values instead of one (\fIZ\fR as a function of \fIX\fR and \fIY\fR
instead of \fIY\fR as a function of \fIX\fR). Thus the first 2 values on each line are
interpreted as the domain instead of just 1. The rest of the processing happens
the same way as before.
.PP
\fITime/date data\fR
.IX Subsection "Time/date data"
.PP
If the input data domain is a time/date, this can be interpreted with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-timefmt\*(C'\fR. This option takes a single argument: the format to use to parse
the data. The format is documented in 'set timefmt' in gnuplot, although the
common flags that \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR understands are generally supported. The backslash
sequences in the format are \fInot\fR supported, so if you want a tab, put in a tab
instead of \et. Whitespace in the format \fIis\fR supported. When this flag is
given, some other options act a little bit differently:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-xlen\*(C'\fR is an \fIinteger\fR in seconds
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-xmin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-xmax\*(C'\fR \fImust\fR use the format passed in to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-timefmt\*(C'\fR
.PP
Using this option changes both the way the input is parsed \fIand\fR the way the
x\-axis tics are labelled. Gnuplot tries to be intelligent in this labelling, but
it doesn't always do what the user wants. The labelling can be controlled with
the gnuplot \f(CW\*(C`set format\*(C'\fR command, which takes the same type of format string as
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-timefmt\*(C'\fR. Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& $ sar 1 \-1 |
\&   awk \*(Aq$1 ~ /..:..:../ && $8 ~/^[0\-9\e.]*$/ {print $1,$8; fflush()}\*(Aq |
\&   feedgnuplot \-\-stream \-\-domain
\&                \-\-lines \-\-timefmt \*(Aq%H:%M:%S\*(Aq
\&                \-\-set \*(Aqformat x "%H:%M:%S"\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
This plots the 'idle' \s-1CPU\s0 consumption against time.
.PP
Note that while gnuplot supports the time/date on any axis, \fIfeedgnuplot\fR
currently supports it \fIonly\fR as the x\-axis domain. This may change in the
future.
.SS "Real-time streaming data"
.IX Subsection "Real-time streaming data"
To plot real-time data, pass in the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-stream [refreshperiod]\*(C'\fR option. Data
will then be plotted as it is received. The plot will be updated every
\&\f(CW\*(C`refreshperiod\*(C'\fR seconds. If the period isn't specified, a 1Hz refresh rate is
used. To refresh at specific intervals indicated by the data, set the
refreshperiod to 0 or to 'trigger'. The plot will then \fIonly\fR be refreshed when
a data line 'replot' is received. This 'replot' command works in both triggered
and timed modes, but in triggered mode, it's the only way to replot. Look in
\&\*(L"Special data commands\*(R" for more information.
.PP
To plot only the most recent data (instead of \fIall\fR the data), \f(CW\*(C`\-\-xlen
windowsize\*(C'\fR can be given. This will create an constantly-updating, scrolling
view of the recent past. \f(CW\*(C`windowsize\*(C'\fR should be replaced by the desired length
of the domain window to plot, in domain units (passed-in values if \f(CW\*(C`\-\-domain\*(C'\fR
or line numbers otherwise). If the domain is a time/date via \f(CW\*(C`\-\-timefmt\*(C'\fR, then
\&\f(CW\*(C`windowsize\*(C'\fR is and \fIinteger\fR in seconds.
.PP
\fISpecial data commands\fR
.IX Subsection "Special data commands"
.PP
If we are reading streaming data, the input stream can contain special commands
in addition to the raw data. Feedgnuplot looks for these at the start of every
input line. If a command is detected, the rest of the line is discarded. These
commands are
.ie n .IP """replot""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWreplot\fR" 4
.IX Item "replot"
This command refreshes the plot right now, instead of waiting for the next
refresh time indicated by the timer. This command works in addition to the timed
refresh, as indicated by \f(CW\*(C`\-\-stream [refreshperiod]\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP """clear""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWclear\fR" 4
.IX Item "clear"
This command clears out the current data in the plot. The plotting process
continues, however, to any data following the \f(CW\*(C`clear\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP """exit""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWexit\fR" 4
.IX Item "exit"
This command causes feedgnuplot to exit.
.SS "Hardcopy output"
.IX Subsection "Hardcopy output"
The script is able to produce hardcopy output with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-hardcopy outputfile\*(C'\fR. The
output type can be inferred from the filename, if \fB.ps\fR, \fB.eps\fR, \fB.pdf\fR,
\&\fB.svg\fR or \fB.png\fR is requested. If any other file type is requested,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-terminal\*(C'\fR \fImust\fR be passed in to tell gnuplot how to make the plot.
.SS "Self-plotting data files"
.IX Subsection "Self-plotting data files"
This script can be used to enable self-plotting data files. There are 2 ways of
doing this: with a shebang (#!) or with inline perl data.
.PP
\fISelf-plotting data with a #!\fR
.IX Subsection "Self-plotting data with a #!"
.PP
A self-plotting, executable data file \f(CW\*(C`data\*(C'\fR is formatted as
.PP
.Vb 10
\& $ cat data
\& #!/usr/bin/feedgnuplot \-\-lines \-\-points
\& 2 1
\& 4 4
\& 6 9
\& 8 16
\& 10 25
\& 12 36
\& 14 49
\& 16 64
\& 18 81
\& 20 100
\& 22 121
\& 24 144
\& 26 169
\& 28 196
\& 30 225
.Ve
.PP
This is the shebang (#!) line followed by the data, formatted as before. The
data file can be plotted simply with
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ ./data
.Ve
.PP
The caveats here are that on Linux the whole #! line is limited to 127
characters and that the full path to feedgnuplot must be given. The 127
character limit is a serious limitation, but this can likely be resolved with a
kernel patch. I have only tried on Linux 2.6.
.PP
\fISelf-plotting data with perl inline data\fR
.IX Subsection "Self-plotting data with perl inline data"
.PP
Perl supports storing data and code in the same file. This can also be used to
create self-plotting files:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& $ cat plotdata.pl
\& #!/usr/bin/perl
\& use strict;
\& use warnings;
\&
\& open PLOT, "| feedgnuplot \-\-lines \-\-points" or die "Couldn\*(Aqt open plotting pipe";
\& while( <DATA> )
\& {
\&   my @xy = split;
\&   print PLOT "@xy\en";
\& }
\& _\|_DATA_\|_
\& 2 1
\& 4 4
\& 6 9
\& 8 16
\& 10 25
\& 12 36
\& 14 49
\& 16 64
\& 18 81
\& 20 100
\& 22 121
\& 24 144
\& 26 169
\& 28 196
\& 30 225
.Ve
.PP
This is especially useful if the logged data is not in a format directly
supported by feedgnuplot. Raw data can be stored after the _\|_DATA_\|_ directive,
with a small perl script to manipulate the data into a useable format and send
it to the plotter.

Normally, histograms are generated with the 'smooth freq' gnuplot style.
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-histstyle\*(C'\fR can be used to select different 'smooth' settings. Allowed are
\&'unique', 'cumulative' and 'cnormal'. 'unique' indicates whether a bin has at

\&'cumulative' is the integral of the \*(L"normal\*(R" histogram. 'cnormal' is like
\&'cumulative', but rescaled to end up at 1.0.

Like \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rangesizeall\*(C'\fR, but instead of overriding the default, adds to it. For

These can be specified both with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rangesizeall 2\*(C'\fR (because there are 2 range
values) or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-extraValuesPerPoint 1\*(C'\fR (because there's 1 more value than usual).
